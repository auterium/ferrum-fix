Fasters is free and open source FIX engine implementation in Rust. Please note that it's currently under heavy development and wildly unstable, so all interested parties should refrain from using it in production prior to `1.0.0` release. Performance and full adherence to the FIX protocol are core goals of the project which, if anything, might serve as a useful foundation for others' work.

## About

Fasters provides parsing, validation, error recovery, and (de)serialization for the FIX Protocol.

![FIX Technical Standard stack](docs/FIX-Technical-Standard-Stack.png)

The above illustration succintly describes the full scope of FIX and it serves as a reference point for all modern FIX implementations. Fasters aims with total compliance... *eventually*. Engineering efforts are initially focused on core features e.g. tag-value encoding and FIX 4.4.

Fasters enforces strict separation of concerns according to the OSI model, as reasonably allowed by the FIX specification.

- Layer 4 (Transport Layer): `fasters::transport`.
- Layer 5 (Session Layer): `fasters::session`.
- Layer 6 (Presentation Layer): `fasters::encoders`.
- Layer 7 (Application Layer): `fasters::app`.

You don't have to understand the whole tech stack to use a single layer; in fact, Fasters makes sure that you only ever need to worry about layers above your chosen abstraction level. For most users, that would be Layer 7 (i.e. semantics of FIX messages and business logic). On the other hand, you will need to delve deep into lower layers in case you plan on building a fully-fledged FIX engine.

**Core features:**

- [X] Code generation (Rust, possibly others).
- [X] FIX 4.2.
- [X] FIX 4.4.
- [X] FIX 5.0 Service Pack 2.

**Encodings:**

- [X] Tagvalue (classic FIX).
- [ ] FIXML.
- [ ] Simple Binary Encoding (SBE).
- [ ] Google Protocol Buffers (GPB).
- [X] JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).
- [ ] Abstract Syntax Notation (ASN.1).
- [ ] FIX Adapted for STreaming (FAST).

## Contributing

All development happens on GitHub at [`neysofu/fasters`](https://github.com/neysofu/fasters). Contributions both from volunteers and companies are welcome. Depending on the size and scope of your intented contributions, it's likely a good idea to open beforehand a pull request to discuss any details. Please note that our branching strategy is inspired by the (in)famous [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), which is a good fit for software that requires complex versioning such as FIX implementations. Versioning adheres to [SemVer 2.0](https://semver.org/).

Please reach out to `Filippo Costa filippo.costa@protonmail.com` if you want to provide more structured and long-term contribution efforts.
